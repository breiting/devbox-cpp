# Development Container

This repository provides a simple yet effective development container with my dotfiles and Neovim installed. It is configured for any C++ projects and mounts the current directory as your working directory inside the container.

## Usage

As a prerequisite, you should have Docker or Podman installed on your system. After that, you can easily build your image by running `make build`.

If everything works out well, you can run the container using `make run`.
